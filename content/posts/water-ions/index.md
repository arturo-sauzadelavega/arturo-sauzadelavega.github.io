#### Abstract

Non-additive effects in hydrogen bonds (HB) take place as a consequence of electronic charge transfers. Therefore, it is natural to expect cooperativity and anticooperativity in ion-water interactions. Nevertheless, investigations on this matter are scarce. This paper addresses the interactions of (i) the cations Lii$^+$, Na$^+$, K$^+$, Be$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$, and Ca$^{2+}$ together with (ii) the anions F$^-$, Cl$^-$, Br$^-$, NO${_3}^{-}$ and SO${_4}^{2-}$ with water clusters (H${_2}$O)$_n$, $n=1-8$, and the effects of these ions on the HBs within the complete molecular adducts. We used quantum chemical topology tools, specifically the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the interacting quantum atoms energy partition to investigate non-additive effects among the interactions studied herein. Our results show a decrease on the interaction energy between ions and the first neighbouring water molecules with an increment of the coordination number. We also found strong cooperative effects in the interplay between HBs and ion-dipole interactions within the studied systems. Such cooperativity affects considerably the interactions among ions with their first and second solvation shells in aqueous environments. Overall, we believe this article provides valuable information about how ion-dipole contacts interact with each other and how they relate to other interactions, such as HBs, in the framework of non-additive effects in aqueous media.


#### Key Ideas

- The interaction energies decrease with the ion size. 
- Increasing the number of waters increased the charge transfer from the ion to the water molecules in the first coordination shell. 
- Oxoanions require more than 8 water molecules to be completely solvated.
