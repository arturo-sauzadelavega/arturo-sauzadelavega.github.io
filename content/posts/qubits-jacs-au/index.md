#### Abstract

Pseudotetrahedral organometallic complexes containing chromium(IV) and aryl ligands have been experimentally identified as promising molecular qubit candidates. Here we present a computational protocol based on multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory for computing singlet–triplet gaps and zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters in Cr(IV) aryl complexes. We find that two multireference methods, multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and hybrid multistate pair-density functional theory (HMS-PDFT), perform better than Kohn–Sham density functional theory for singlet–triplet gaps. Despite the very small values of the ZFS parameters, both multireference methods performed qualitatively well. MS-CASPT2 and HMS-PDFT performed particularly well for predicting the trend in the ratio of the rhombic and axial ZFS parameters, $|E/D|$. We have also investigated the dependence and sensitivity of the calculated ZFS parameters on the active space and the molecular geometry. The methodologies outlined here can guide future prediction of ZFS parameters in molecular qubit candidates.

#### Key Ideas

- The molecular geometry is extremely important when trying to reproduce the ZFS parameters in the order of GHz.
- To obtain a semiquantitative approximation of the axial and rhombic parameters, large active spaces display better results for both, CASPT2 and MC-PDFT methods.
- The hybrid MC-PDFT tested functional accurately described the triplet-singlet energy gaps for all molecules tested herein.
- Both, CASPT2 and hybrid MC-PDFT recovers the same semi-quantitative trend of the axial parameter and the ratio $|E/D|$.
