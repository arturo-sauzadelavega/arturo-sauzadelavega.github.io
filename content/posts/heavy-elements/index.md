## Summary

Write a detailed summary of the project here. You can write as much
as you need, including equations using $...$ for inline math or
$$...$$ for display math.

For example: The spin Hamiltonian is given by $$\hat{H} = D\hat{S}_z^2$$

## Objectives

- Investigate the electronic structure of transition metal complexes
- Model magnetic properties using ab initio methods
- Identify design principles for improved qubit coherence times
