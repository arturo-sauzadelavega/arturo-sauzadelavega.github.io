# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Iowa, where I explore the complex electronic structures of molecular qubits,  lanthanide, actinide, and transition metal systems. My research spans a wide range of interests, from single-ion complexes to larger molecular clusters, using high-level quantum chemical calculations. I specialize in modeling magnetic and spectroscopic properties, as well as performing rigorous analyses of chemical bonding and noncovalent interactions through the lens of quantum chemical topology.'
